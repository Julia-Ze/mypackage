Description: The package enables the user to perform extreme value analysis 
  using the Peaks Over Threshold method of extracting extremes. It allows users 
  to define a flexible threshold and fits Generalized Additive Models for Location,
  Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) to the threshold excesses which enables smooth, 
  covariate-dependent modelling of extremes.
